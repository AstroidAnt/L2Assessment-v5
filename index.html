    <p> They do not only contribute to the beauty New Zealand beholds but is also home to much of the country's wildlife. It is extremely important to keep these waterways clean and healthy. To show the importance of this, the example of Lake Wairarapa will be shown across this website. Important concepts are shown below before an analysis of how Lake Wairarapa has been affected by humans.</p> <br>

        <h3>Before the Diversion</h3>
        <p>Lake Wairarapa's ecosystem changed drastically after the diversion, the surrounding land and the Lakes mauri were both affected by the diversion. The Lakes Health was once heavily biodiverse and the water healthy. We can understand the lake's previous ecosystem and the biodiversity it contained, from the once very large wetlands that existed around the lake. The wetlands provided riparian planting that strengthened the health of the lake by removing nitrates and phosphates from the water to keep it clean and safe for many organisms that the lake is a habitat for.</p>

        <p>There are many stories that prove Lake Wairapapa's previous “glistening waters” such as the story of Hau, a traveler who saw the lake and spoke of its beautiful clear waters. Before the diversion, Tuna Kuwharuwharu were abundant in the lake increasing it's biodiversity. With the large wetlands around the lake, it meant there was no close farmland to the water, this reduced run-off from entering the lake and affecting its health. The steady intake and outflow of water in the lake, meant the lake's water was flowing and provided flushing of the lake's water that may have been polluted by runoff, this was also assisted by the wetlands and riparian planting soaking up unwanted chemicals.</p>

      <h2> The Diversion </h2> 
          <hr><br>
        <p>In June 1947, there was a flood that put 60,000 hectares of land underwater which pressured the formation of the Wairarapa Catchment Board who decided to create a diversion. This plan meant building a diversion of the Ruamahanga River from Lake Wairarapa, its natural bypass, to Lake Onoke. This would drain the wetlands and the installation of flood gates would be used to regulate water flow into Lake Wairarapa. This was done to reduce the flooding of farmland around the lake. The creation of the diversion started in the 1960s, cost 1.5 million dollars and took 20 years to complete.<p>

       <h3>After the Diversion</h3>  
        <p>The diversion caused the environment of the lake to change and as planned, reduced flooding of nearby farmland. The diversion drained the large wetlands around the lake, which caused a large loss of riparian planting. This greatly affected and changed the lake's ecosystem and its biodiversity. Due to farmland being close to the lake, run-off from farmland increased and with the reduction of riparian planting, the health of the lake's water heavily decreased. Riparian planting soaks up nitrates and phosphates and when the amount of planting around the lake is decreased, levels of nitrates and phosphates in the water increase. This is clear from water testing at the lake which found high levels of nitrate in the water (1.772mg) and its supertrophic water quality that has been previously tested.</p>
      <p>The levels of nitrates and phosphates are also increased by the stagnant water. Without the natural intake and outflow of water, the lake cannot flush water. With a loss of riparian planting around the banks of the lake it also creates weaker banks that are more likely to break off into the water. When the sediment on the banks falls into the water after flooding or strong weather the water clarity decreases. When the water clarity decreases, fish and other organisms in the lake struggle to find food. It can also be said that the water temperature of the lake has increased after the diversion due to the loss of planting around the lake that once provided shade to keep the water less exposed to sunlight and less likely to fluctuate in temperature.</p>
